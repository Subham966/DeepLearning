# **Breast Cancer Classification:**

This project focuses on accurately classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using deep learning techniques. By analyzing medical imaging data, the model aims to provide reliable predictions for effective diagnosis. The project leverages state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures and is trained on a comprehensive dataset of annotated breast tumor images. With high precision and recall rates, this model holds the potential to assist medical professionals in making informed decisions and improving patient outcomes in breast cancer diagnosis.


# **Handwritten Digit Recognition:**

This project aims to accurately recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on the widely-used MNIST dataset, consisting of thousands of labeled handwritten digit images. By employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multiple layers, the model learns to extract meaningful features from the input images and classify them into the correct digit category. With high accuracy rates, this project offers a valuable tool for digit recognition applications, such as automatic form processing or optical character recognition (OCR) systems.


# **Image Classification:**

This project focuses on image classification using deep learning methods. By leveraging deep convolutional neural networks, the model is capable of accurately categorizing images into different classes or labels. The model learns to recognize distinctive patterns and features in the input images, enabling it to make precise predictions. With training on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet, the model can effectively classify a wide variety of objects, scenes, or concepts. Image classification has numerous practical applications, including content-based image retrieval, autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis.
